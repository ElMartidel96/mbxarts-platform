## The Problem We Solve

- **With emotions**: Each gift is personalized with AI art

## How It Works

### Step 2: Share with Love

The recipient receives:
- A unique and secure link
- QR code for easy sharing
- Password you define
- Optional education included

### Step 3: Frictionless Claiming

<Callout type="success">
  The recipient doesn't need:
  - A previous wallet
  - To buy ETH for gas
  - Knowledge about crypto
  - To install complex apps
</Callout>

## The Revolutionary Technology

### ERC-6551: NFT = Real Wallet

```solidity
// Each NFT has a deterministic wallet
address wallet = registry.createAccount(
    implementation,
    chainId,
    nftContract,
    tokenId,
    salt,
    initData
);
```

This innovation means:
- The NFT **IS** the wallet
- Can receive any ERC-20 token
- Is transferable like any NFT
- Has unique on-chain identity

### Account Abstraction: Zero Friction
